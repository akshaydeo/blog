<p>I am a moderate user of Twitter. One of the biggest reasons for being on twitter is the love for the free flowing
    knowledge by industry leaders and influencers. Another biggest reason is, Twitter Polls. They are funny, informative
    and engaging.</p>
<p>But finding interesting Twitter polls is difficult‚ùó</p>
<p>Hence I thought of building PollScout app to help me and (hopefully) everyone to bookmark interesting polls and make
    them discoverable.</p>
<p>For tracking a poll, just reply to any Poll tweet with <code>@pollscout track #hashtag1 #hashtag2</code></p>
