<p>Remote working culture is inevitable. Doesn't matter if you like it or not. And one of the most important component
    of remote working is asynchronous communications.</p>

<p>Screen recording becomes really crucial to the daily workflows of remote work. Be it feature showcase, product demos,
    new employee on-boarding etc. It avoids back and forth emails, long (and unreadable documents), confusing text
    messages.</p>

<h3>But there are a lot of screen recording apps in the market, why did I build another?</h3>


<span>Most of the popular screen recording apps are based on web technologies (Electron). Electron is good as it allows you to run same piece of code on Mac, Windows and Linux. But it comes with its own disadvantages

<span style="font-weight: bold;">üß† High RAM consumption:</span><br/>
<span>Loom consumes 200 MB of RAM even if you are not using the app.</span><br/>

<div class="alert alert-secondary">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">üîã High CPU and battery consumption :</span><br/>
<span>Running Electron based apps is like running a Chrome browser. It's heavy on your CPU and battery.</span><br/>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">üï∏ Some of these apps don't work when you are offline!</span><br/>

<span>When you record a video, you should be able to decide how would you like to distribute it. Most of the available apps do not allow it out of the box.</span>
