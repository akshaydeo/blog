<h2>üí≠ Background</h2>

<p>
  Throughout my career, I have experimented a lot. Those were related to
  startups, products, exercise, meditation; possibly everything that I have done
  in my life. I would be lying if I say that I did not care about the results.
  But as I went on; or as some would say, got enough experience, I realized that
  there are two ways you can carry out any kind of experiment effectively
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Focus on the journey.</li>
  <li>Focus on the result.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  There is no right or wrong between these two. These are just paths to the same
  destination, from which you have to select one! I have tried both of these in
  different spectrum till now.
</p>

<p>Let's think of this in the context of travelling from A to B.</p>

  <img src="/public/images/12x12_journey.png" class="text-center img-fluid" alt="Journey" />
</div>
<p>In Focus on the journey approach, I will make sure that</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    I will try to maximize the experiences throughout the journey. Will spend
    enough of time in planning the itinerary.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will not consider much about the expenses, as the aim is to maximize the
    happiness quotient of the journey.
  </li>
  <li>Would not care about the time to reach to the destination.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Focus on the result</p>
<ul>
  <li>I will book a flight, and possibly the cheapest one.</li>
  <li>
    The journey will be comfortable but not as enjoyable as in earlier method.
  </li>
  <li>
    The approach would be to reach the destination as fast as possible with
    least expenses (time and money).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>üßê Product Building Philosophy</h2>

<p>
  I have been building a lot of products (hate calling them side projects)
  throughout my career. I have built 18 products in the last 10 years, out of
  which 1 became a real company. That company failed to go from zero to one üíî.
  It's a decent scorecard in the world of startups.
</p>

<p>
  In the last retrospect (per quarter affair), I realized that there was
  something wrong with the way I was building products. I was investing too much
  energy, time, and hope into it! For example, I spent almost 9 months to build
  Viwr from grounds up; just to realize that the niche set of customers I was
  focusing on, would not trust on a side project built by one person as a
  part-time gig. In this case, I went with my gut without any user research.
</p>
<p>
  In another case, I decided to start with paid surveys on twitter. Got 1500
  people to vote on it! I thought I have something that considerable set of
  users need and spent almost 7 months building the most perfect, secure fintech
  app just to realize that some recently implemented regulations will make this
  product illegal.
</p>

<p>
  To speak in the language of experiments, I was focusing too much on the
  journey when the end goal was not clear. And I decided to change that for the
  next couple of years ‚úåÔ∏è.
</p>

<h2>ü•Å 12x12</h2>

<p>
  12x12 simply indicates 12 products in 12 months. The story behind this
  decision is two folds.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    During my retrospect, I decided to move to
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Focus on the Goal</span> approach to
    speed up the iterations of my products.
  </li>
  <li>
    I stumbled upon
    <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Pieter Levels' blog</span>! Who did
    something similar and found success in his 7th product! It was kind of a
    validation for this approach.
  </li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">How does it work?</p>
<p>
  I am going to pick 12 amazing ideas and build them one by one every month. The
  goal is to build and release one product in a month! It doesn't matter how
  crappy it is, or MVPish but people should be able to use the core
  functionality and give some constructive feedback!
</p>

<p>
  As I am a full stack developer, building a product (tech) has always been the
  easiest task of the product development process. But with this aggressive
  goal, it even challenges that development process! I have to decide what is
  quicker vs what is better. Perfection has to be my enemy!
</p>

<p>
  This is going to be an exciting journey! And I wanted to do it with everyone
  who would love to know what happens ü§ó. This page is going to be the log of my
  side projects and experiences I get throughout this process!
