<h2>üë¥ Background</h2>

<p>I have experimented a lot throughout my career. Those experiments involved job, startup, products, games; possibly
    everything that I have done in my life. I would be lying if I say that I did not care about the results or I was
    okay
    being wrong üòá. But as I went on; or as some would say, got enough experience, I realized that there are two ways
    you
    can carry out any kind of experiment effectively</p>

<ol>
    <li>Focus on the journey.</li>
    <li>Focus on the result.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no right or wrong between these two. These are factual cores from which you have to select one!
    I have tried both of these in different spectrum till now.</p>

<p>Let's think of this in the context of travelling from A to B.</p>

         alt="Journey">
</div>
<p>In Focus on the journey approach, I will make sure that</p>
<ul>
    <li>I will try to maximize the experiences throughout the journey. Will spend enough of time in planning the
        itinerary.
    </li>
    <li>I will not consider much about the expenses, as the aim is to maximize the happiness quotient of the journey.
    </li>
    <li>It might take a bit longer than usual to reach to the destination.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Focus on the result</p>
<ul>
    <li>I will book a flight, and possibly the cheapest one.</li>
    <li>The journey will be comfortable but not as enjoyable as in earlier method.</li>
    <li>The approach would be to reach the destination as fast as possible with least expenses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üßê Product Building Philosophy</h2>

<p>I have been building a lot of products (hate calling them side projects) throughout my career. Objectively, I have
    built 18 products in the last 10 years, out of which 1 became a real company. That company failed to go from zero to
    one üíî.</p>

<p>If you compare it with the average number of products being built vs they turning into a real company. This is a
    decent scorecard.</p>

<p>In the last retrospect (per quarter affair), I realized that there was something wrong with my philosophy of building
    products. I was investing too much energy, time, and hope into it! For example, I spent almost 9 months to build
    Viwr from grounds up just to realize that the niche I was focusing would not trust on a side project built by
    someone sitting in India. I generally do not believe in user research, unless the sample set is high enough.</p>
<p>In another case, I decided to start with paid surveys on twitter for the next product I wanted to build. Got 1500
    people to vote on it, and that's it! I thought I have the market fit and spent almost 7 months building the most
    perfect, secure fintech app just to realize that some recently implemented regulations will make this product
    illegal.</p>

<p>To speak in the language of experiments, I was focusing too much on the journey when the end goal was not clear. And
    I decided to change that for the next couple of years ‚úåÔ∏è.</p>


<h2>ü•Å 12x12</h2>

<p>12x12 simply indicates 12 products in 12 months. The story behind this decision is two folds.</p>
<ol>
    <li>During my retrospect, I decided to move into <span style="font-weight: bolder">Focus on the Goal</span> approach
        to speed up the iterations of my products.
    </li>
    <li>I stumbled upon <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Pieter Levels' blog</span>! Who did something similar and
        found success in his 7th product!
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Now how does this thing is going to work? I am going to pick 12 amazing ideas and build them one by one every month.
    The goal is to build and release one product in a month! It doesn't matter how crappy it is, or MVPish but people
    should be able to use the core functionality and give some constructive feedback!</p>

<p>As I am a full stack developer, building a product (tech) has always been the easiest task of the product development
    process. But with this aggressive goal, it even challenges that development process! I have to decide what is
    quicker vs what is better. Perfection has to be my enemy!</p>

<p>This is going to be an exciting journey! And I wanted to do it with everyone who would love to know what happens ü§ó.
    This page is going to be the log of my side projects and experiences I get throughout this process!</p>

<p>I am a moderate user of Twitter. One of the biggest reasons for being on twitter is the love for the free flowing
    knowledge by industry leaders and influencers. Another biggest reason is, Twitter Polls. They are funny, informative
    and engaging.</p>
<p>But finding interesting Twitter polls is difficult‚ùó</p>
<p>Hence I thought of building PollScout app to help me and (hopefully) everyone to bookmark interesting polls and make
    them discoverable.</p>
<p>For tracking a poll, just reply to any Poll tweet with <code>@pollscout track #hashtag1 #hashtag2</code></p>
