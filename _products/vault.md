## What happened? ðŸ’”

### Technical difficulties

- I build the first version using Yodlee APIs. But these APIs were very flaky and most of the times went down. So I had to build a lot of workflows to automtically detect failures.
- Over the time during beta phase we realized that we have to build the base solution ourselves.

### Localized problems

- Very few or almost none of the leading banks in India have sophisticated and off-the-shelf usable APIs. This made our job really difficult.
- Eventually we built something like Yodlee in-house based on the scraping mechanism. This solution worked really well and much better than Yodlee.

### Legal problems

- The RBI approved Account Aggregater licence and made it mandotory for building businesses like Vault. And it was a major hurdle for us. We had to go through a lot of legal and regulatory hurdles plus it had some monetory cost which was difficult for us to pay without external funding.
- Getting that licence itself was a big deal. On top of there was a lot of confusion around the capabilities, process and data handling.
