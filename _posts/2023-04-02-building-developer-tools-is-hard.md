> While anyone can certainly benefit from this post, its primary focus is on early-stage founders of developer tooling companies.

Selling developer tools to developers is like selling furniture to carpenters. While the developers can always build (vs. buy) similar tools themselves, the critical point is whether they can build them as **efficiently**, **effectively**, and with the same level of **quality** as yours, as well as whether creating such tools aligns with their current priorities and goals

It's common for developers to overestimate their abilities and underestimate the complexity of the challenges they face. For example, Abhinav Asthana, the founder of Postman, once remarked that many people believed they could create Postman in a single weekend. However, what they typically have in mind is a simplified version of Postman based on their understanding. However, as they delve deeper into the development process, they discover that the reality is far more intricate than they had initially envisioned, and unexpected complexities inevitably arise.

**Many of your customers are naturally inclined to build solutions themselves, given a choice between build, buy, and borrow.** However, specific problems are better addressed through purchasing or borrowing solutions due to complexity, domain understanding, immediate importance, or the maintenance overhead involved. For instance, databases, key-value stores, infrastructure, hosted open-source solutions blog engines are all examples of technologies for which companies (i.e., developers) may prefer to purchase or borrow rather than build from scratch.

As true for any company, your top priority is communicating your value proposition in a way that resonates with your target audience. While developers may be impressed by your product's technical prowess, highlighting its tangible benefits and how it can significantly improve their workflow is essential. With that in mind, there's a particular micro-framework that I refer to as a litmus test for developer tools. You can employ this framework to inform various aspects of your product, such as packaging, sales pitch, website design, and product onboarding, among others.

## The number of touchpoints required for adoption/evaluation should be as low as possible, ideally one!

If you are building a tool similar to NewRelic, an infrastructure monitoring tool widely used by companies, the primary stakeholders for selling your product are likely the engineering teams and SREs. These individuals will benefit most directly from your tool's value proposition. Additionally, the security team will play a critical role in evaluating the tool's security features and ensuring compliance with relevant laws regarding data tenancy. Integrating or evaluating a tool like this can be time-consuming and costly, involving DevOps and engineering work. This makes the evaluation process longer and more difficult for both sides.

On the other hand, anyone from any team can adopt VSCode Editor editor without breaking anyone else's workflow. Once they find it useful, they start advocating it within the team, and that's how bottom-up adoption starts. Hence it's easier for your customer to evaluate something like VSCode.

Understanding these touchpoints and personas can help guide your growth strategy. For example, if your product requires a high degree of customization and support, you may need a sales-driven approach. In contrast, if your product is easy to use and requires little setup, a self-serve/product-led approach may be more appropriate.

Identifying the target customer persona through these touchpoints is also essential, as different individuals within an organization may have different priorities and concerns. For example, a CTO may prioritize security and scalability, while a Head of Product may prioritize ease of use and feature sets. Knowing your target customer persona can help you tailor your product and messaging to meet their specific needs.

Prioritizing product development efforts is another critical aspect of understanding touchpoints and personas. For example, suppose your target customer persona is a security head; in that case, prioritizing security certifications and integrations with existing tooling ecosystems may be more important than adding new features.

Understanding touchpoints and personas can inform your pricing strategy. For example, if your target customer persona is engineers, offering a freemium model that allows them to try your product before committing to a paid plan may be more effective than requiring payment upfront.

By identifying and understanding the various touchpoints and personas involved in product adoption, you can optimize your growth strategy, target the right customers, prioritize development efforts, and design a pricing strategy that appeals to your target audience.

Developing developer tools is a challenging task. The rules that apply to other industries or sectors may not always translate well into the world of developer tools. However, these unique challenges make it an exciting and intriguing space.
