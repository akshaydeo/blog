APIs are the foundation of modern applications. From complex financial flows to simplest photo-sharing apps breath through APIs. I've been professionally working since 2010, and since then I've seen APIs becoming more and more central in day to day development lifecycle.

During this shift, Postman was one of those few companies that understood the importance of building sophisticated workflows around API development. Fast forward 8 years, Postman built the entire ecosystem of collaborative API design, development, mocking, monitoring, documentation.

I've been using Postman for almost 7 years now. And still being fascinated by the immense grasp over predicting the future of API development tools. On another spectrum, as an entrepreneur, I've always loved the natural progression of the Postman from a side-project to an actual company.

**I am super excited to share that I am going to be the part of the Postman's engineering team 🎉**. When I was speaking with Ankit, Abhinav, and the rest of the leadership, I realized that Postman has a strong mission and an entrepreneurial approach for achieving it.

I will be focussing on our 3 products
1. [API Mock and Design](https://www.postman.com/features/mock-api/)
2. [API Documentation](https://www.postman.com/api-documentation-tool/)
3. [API Platform](https://www.postman.com/api-platform/)

**Another exciting news is, Postman is going to have a presence in Pune, 🇮🇳**. Postman is principally a remote-first company spread across 5 continents and 7 countries, but we are also open to working from an office. Get in touch with me if you are interested in becoming part of this mission from Pune, Bangalore or Remote 🙇‍♂️.
