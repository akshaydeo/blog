APIs are the foundation of modern applications. From complex financial flows to simplest photo-sharing apps breath through APIs. Over the last decade, I've seen APIs becoming central to the software development lifecycle.

During this shift, Postman was a few companies that understood the importance of building sophisticated workflows around API development. Fast forward eight years, Postman built the entire ecosystem of collaborative API design, development, mocking, monitoring, documentation.

I've been using Postman for almost seven years now. And I am still being fascinated by the immense grasp over predicting the future of API development tools. On another side, I've always loved the natural progression from a side-project to an actual company.

When I spoke with Ankit, Abhinav, and the rest of the leadership, I learned the ambitious mission and the systematic approach for achieving it. There are many synergies between the way I think of work and the way Postman works as a company. Watch this presentation by Ankit (CTO) in SAAS conference 2020.
