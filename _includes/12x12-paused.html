            I am going to write a detailed post on my experience, but long story
            short, working full-time + creating a new product every month was
            overwhelming.<br />I was not able to give justice to every idea I was
            building and tend to release/leave in between.<br /><br />But with a ton
            of experience and understanding, 2021 is going to be the year of 6x6.
            Where I will focus on 6 different Ideas, and will be building them in
            the span of 2 months.<br /><br />Till then, happy coding ðŸŽ‰
