                    <span>I am going to write a detailed post on my
                        experience, but long story short, working full-time + creating a new product every month was
                        overwhelming.<br />I was not able to give justice to every idea I was building and tend to
                        release/leave in between.<br/><br/>But with a ton of experience and understanding, 2021 is going to be the year of 6x6. Where I will focus on 6 different Ideas, and will be building them in the span of 2 months.<br/><br/>Till then, happy coding ðŸŽ‰</span>
