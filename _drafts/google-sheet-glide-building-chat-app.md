# Building a basic chat app using Google Sheet and Glide

Recently, I have started working on an app which flows out a daily workout and lists out a global leaderboard sorted using their total time.

For building the MVP, we started bringing people from different groups onto a Google sheet. But Google sheet way was a bit messy and we started figuring out a faster way to build this community.

I am reasonably active on ProductHunt. I had read about Glide during their product hunt release. When I revisited Glide, I was blown away by the maturity and extensibility of the Product. We decided to build the mobile website using Glide.

Now [DailyOne]() app had a complicated set of relations and data models. But I thought this product should reach to as many people as it can.

So I picked up a another demo app. A Forum app. Here are the features :

1. There will 2 types of forums. Public forums and Private forums.
2. User will have to sign-in using their Google account / Email account.
3. Any logged in user can create a forum.
4. User will see all the available forums. On the first screen they will see all the foruns they are part of.
5. There will be a button which will list all the global forum list, which are open to public. And user can click on them and join that forum.
6. Members of a forum can post messages.

Let's see how can we build this using Glide
