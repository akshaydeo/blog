## 🖖 Consistency
- Everything that we as managers do has to be consistent.
- Any strategy / policy becomes effective when its applied for sufficiently long periods. So pick the tools that you are comfortable with, and implement only if you pledge to be consistently using them.

## ♻️ Iterative
- Change is the only constant. And every process needs changes and iterations to make it perfect. 
- Keep these processes open for iterations. 
- Don't add exceptions, count the exceptions and update the process if an exception is common over a considerable amount of time. 
 
## 🤖 Automated
- Engineers hate monotony and redundancy. And they should!
- So make sure that the processes will take advantages of advanced APIs, ML, NLP systems to remove the friction.
- Trigger -> Action -> Variable Rewards -> Investment [[Hooked]]
	- Trigger is the automation part. Push Slack notifications for entering info. Or worst case an email. (I <3 Slack)
	- Action happens out of Intention [[The Power Of Habits]]
	- Rewards are in terms of Growth, Happiness, Work Satisfaction!
	- Investment is Tracking these actions.

## 🥊 Actionable
- Outcome from each of the process under #AEMP will be actionable. 
- Each actionable output should be converted into a metric and tracked throughout the lifetime of the action.

## ⭕️ Complete the Loop
- Most of the processes adopted by teams do not complete the loop. So no one can learn from these processes and keep on repeating almost the same mistakes in different forms.

## 📜 Clear set of Priorities

## 📣 Clear Communication
- Sometimes leaders of the team can not firmly establish the crystal clear directions of the culture code / expectations from the team members.

## 🤗 Creating complaint friendly environment
- Force team leads / project leads to create private channels, which are not accessible to the managers / leadership where every person in the team can voice all their problems.
- Never attribute problems to specific people, if one person is having a problem with any situation / scenario
