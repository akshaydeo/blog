👋, I am Akshay Deo, a Computer Engineer from Pune (India). I am currently working as a Staff Engineer (Backend/Android) at Slack. You can get in touch with me at [akshay@akshaydeo.com](mailto://akshay@akshaydeo.com).

## Background

I wrote my first computer program when I was in 10th grade for my dad’s construction company. Since then I have been writing software 👨‍💻.

I have worked on a wide range of tech stacks including VBScript, ActionScript 2.0, LAMP, C#, Django, Play framework, Netty, Go, NodeJS + Typescript, ReactJS, Hack 🤓.

## Startup life

In 2012, at the age of 23, I founded a company called RainingClouds along with 3 other co-founders. We built a product, AppSurfer, which in brief, runs Android on the cloud and can stream on any platform. We got a lot of 🗞 on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/11/appsurfer-takes-android-apps-to-the-browser-lets-you-embed-them-anywhere/), again on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/try-before-you-buy-app-demo-platform-appsurfer-lets-you-test-apps-on-facebook-debuts-an-android-app-of-its-own/), [TheNextWeb](https://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/11/27/try-before-you-buy-appsurfer-lets-d/#.tnw_lJ48mLih) and [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2013/01/21/appsurfer-adds-tablet-apps-to-web-based-try-before-you-buy-android-app-demos/) to name a few.

We successfully raised 1 crore INR (~200K 💰) as seed funding from One97 Mobility fund run by [Vijay Shekhar Sharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Shekhar_Sharma).

For the next couple of years, we tried multiple use cases around this tech but sooner or later the economics of running the business and revenue did not match to convert this into a profitable business 😞. Eventually, most of the products we had built were built by [Google](https://google.com). We have detailed out these product comparisons [here](https://blog.appsurfer.com/post/145253504285/appsurfer-bids-adieu).

## Back to consultancy

When we were almost out of 💵, I went back to consulting to support the development of AppSurfer. During that time I worked with one of the best Fintech startups in India, [Simpl](https://getsimpl.com). I built first version of Simpl's Android App, SDK and realtime authentication microservice.

## Twist, a better stick than Amazon FireStick

After AppSurfer, we briefly worked on a hardware product called [Twist](https://web.archive.org/web/20151030065825/http://www.gettwist.tv/). The vision of the product was, every HDMI stick that was launching had a separate remote for operating the device. But everyone has possibly the most powerful machine in their pockets, their phones. Why can’t we use that as a remote for the TV?

We took this idea a little further, by converting phones into a game controller as well.

But we were running on a very thin runway, and couldn't launch it into the market.

## Joining forces with Media.Net

When Google announced Instant Apps for Android, we decided to shut down AppSurfer with a detailed [blog post](https://blog.appsurfer.com/post/145253504285/appsurfer-bids-adieu). [Vaibhav Arya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavarya/), then CTO and now CEO of the Media.net, read this blog post and offered us to join the forces with Media.Net. I worked there for 3 years as (Senior) Tech Lead on InApp (Mobile) Products.
