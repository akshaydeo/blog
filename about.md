            ðŸ‘‹, I am Akshay Deo, a Computer Engineer from Pune ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. <em>I have co-founded 3 startups, out of them 1 failed, 1 we couldn't launch and 1 got acqui-hired.</em> 
            <br/><br/>                        
            I have been facinated by ðŸ’» since childhood. Seeing my dad working on a 286 with MSDos 3.1, was always awe-inspiring ðŸ˜² for me. Later this transpired into a life-long hobby/profession for me ðŸ’¼.
            <br/><br/>                        
            I wrote my first computer program when I was in 10th grade for my dadâ€™s construction company, using VB Script 6.0 and MS Access DB. I am hands-on fullstack developer (Android, iOS, ReactJS, Java, Go, NodeJS, Php/Hack) and experienced engineering manager. 
            <br/><br/>            
            I currently work as a Staff Engineer at <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>. Before Slack, I have worked as a Senior Technical Lead / Engineering Manager (TLM) at <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="https://media.net">Media.Net</a> on Mobile Ad products.

## Startup life

In 2012, at the age of 23, I founded a company called RainingClouds along with 3 other co-founders. We built a product, AppSurfer, which in brief, runs Android on the cloud and can stream on any platform. We got a lot of ðŸ—ž on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/11/appsurfer-takes-android-apps-to-the-browser-lets-you-embed-them-anywhere/), again on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/try-before-you-buy-app-demo-platform-appsurfer-lets-you-test-apps-on-facebook-debuts-an-android-app-of-its-own/), [TheNextWeb](https://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/11/27/try-before-you-buy-appsurfer-lets-d/#.tnw_lJ48mLih) and [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2013/01/21/appsurfer-adds-tablet-apps-to-web-based-try-before-you-buy-android-app-demos/) to name a few.

We successfully raised 1 crore INR (~200K ðŸ’°) as seed funding from One97 Mobility fund run by [Vijay Shekhar Sharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Shekhar_Sharma).

For the next couple of years, we tried multiple use cases around this tech but sooner or later the economics of running the business and revenue did not match to convert this into a profitable business ðŸ˜ž. Eventually, most of the products we had built were built by [Google](https://google.com). We have detailed out these product comparisons [here](https://blog.appsurfer.com/post/145253504285/appsurfer-bids-adieu).

## Back to consultancy

When we were almost out of ðŸ’µ, I went back to consulting to support the development of AppSurfer. During that time I worked with one of the best Fintech startups in India, [Simpl](https://getsimpl.com). I built first version of Simpl's Android App, SDK and realtime authentication microservice.

## Twist, a better stick than Amazon FireStick

After AppSurfer, we briefly worked on a hardware product called [Twist](https://web.archive.org/web/20151030065825/http://www.gettwist.tv/). The vision of the product was, every HDMI stick that was launching had a separate remote for operating the device. But everyone has possibly the most powerful machine in their pockets, their phones. Why canâ€™t we use that as a remote for the TV?

We took this idea a little further, by converting phones into a game controller as well.

But we were running on a very thin runway, and couldn't launch it into the market.

## Joining forces with Media.Net

When Google announced Instant Apps for Android, we decided to shut down AppSurfer with a detailed [blog post](https://blog.appsurfer.com/post/145253504285/appsurfer-bids-adieu). [Vaibhav Arya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavarya/), then CTO and now CEO of the Media.net, read this blog post and offered us to join the forces with Media.Net.
