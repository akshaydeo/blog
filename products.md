# [Viwr](https://viwr.app) (2019-20)
Conclusion: Failed üíî

### For Android Developers
Viwr has different features like screen mirroring, location mocking, battery mocking, CPU analysis, memory analysis, battery analysis, network mocking etc features that help them to speed up the development as well as making sure that the app handles different scenarios really well.

### For Android Testers
Viwr helps to create different analysis reports like [this](https://reports.viwr.app/?id=483ee408-a6b5-446d-a756-3e6b5577fde1), which are one click sharable with developers/clients giving a clear picture about how the app is performing.

# [Twist](https://web.archive.org/web/20151030065825/http://www.gettwist.tv/) (2015-2016)
Conclusion: Never launched üíî

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 offset-md-3" style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;">
<iframe style="display:block;margin:auto;min-height:250px;padding:5px;" width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuCPw8l_kts" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This was a hardware product. The vision for the product was, to convert the most powerful computer in everyones' pocket i.e. **smart phones into a remote control for the TV**. 
We took this idea a little further, by converting phones into a game controller as well ü§©.

# AppSurfer (2011-2014)
Conclusion: Failed üíî

AppSurfer was the biggest and most ambitious project I have worked on, which went on to become a real VC funded company. 
We had build AppSurfer (I and 3 other co-founders) with the intention of bringing Android in the cloud. Got a lot of recognition and love from tech community.

Throughout the life of the product, we tried 4 different use-cases, none of which worked. Eventually every bit was built by Google and we decided to shut it down.

# GroupUp (2014)

Conclusion: Failed üíî

GroupUp was a reverse GroupOn for purchasing goods in a group. People create/join group for buying a product, and start sharing them across social network, so as to grow that group and get a GROUP DISCOUNT.

### Why? (Pitch from the deck I had prepared then)

- According to Google India, there were 35 million online shoppers in India in 2014 Q1 and is expected to cross 100 million mark by end of year 2016.
- In India, people postpone their purchases for Diwali, Dussehra, New years expecting sales during that period.
- They also contact friends, relatives from US during black friday sales.
- E-commerce players like Flipkart, Amazon.in, Snapdeal are coming up with huge discount sales.
We are doing this, thinking What if we attach a bulk purchase to these discounts ?

# Keen (2014-2015)

Conclusion: Never Launched üíî

<img width="100%" style="max-width:300px;margin:auto;" src="/public/images/keen_logo.png"/>

- A live StackOverflow which can start with a chat, call, video call etc.
- Main objective of the app is to provide instant help on problems using mobile chat system.
- There are no anonymous users in the system. 
- Login should be using either Facebook, Google+. 
- Questions can be asked to relevant online people only. Once you complete the discussion, asker would give a hi5 as a gratitude and also which is the magnitude of the askees‚Äô rank in the system. Hi5 indicates that the discussion was fruitful. 100% hi5s‚Äô is the target of the system.

# Project Zero (2014-2015)
